## What to gitignore

It looks like gitignoring in Flutter is a big mess.
I'm not quite sure if the template is really up-to-date in terms of its `.gitignore`.
Looks like it wants to commit a lot of noise that feels generated (or at least should be under the control of the Flutter framework).
The template comes from here:
- https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/656447127360f389513d0b689d7b4a6ebfb75800/packages/flutter_tools/templates/app_shared/.gitignore.tmpl

Documentation and SO posts on the topic are very poor. Some references:
